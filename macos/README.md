# Mac OSX

This is my setup to make my development environment more portable.

## Install

Install `brew` and apps in `Brewfile` (this will take a while)

* Brewfile uses regular [brew apps](http://searchbrew.com/) and [cask apps](https://caskroom.github.io/search)

    ./brew.sh

Update the dock. Sometimes dock items will show up as question marks.

    ./dock.sh

Setup [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) shell

    ./shell.sh

Install LTS node

    ./node.sh
